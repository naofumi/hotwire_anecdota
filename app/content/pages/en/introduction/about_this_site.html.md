This site is aimed at engineers who have already learned some Hotwire
but haven't yet found a set of best practices that suits how they want to use it.

Here, I will introduce my own opinionated approach and way of thinking about Hotwire, based on my experiences.

## Creating the Best UI/UX with Hotwire --- how-to-make-great-ui

**The purpose of this site is to "create high-level UI/UX with Hotwire."**

The goal is not to introduce ideas such as "You don't need to use JavaScript if you use Hotwire" or "You can easily create UIs with Hotwire." Such information can be widely found on the internet through tutorial-like resources. Of course, Hotwire can also be used in this way, but the aim of this site is **to create UI/UX that is on par with or even exceeds what can be made using React/Next.js and similar tools.**

This site introduces how Hotwire resolves what is referred to as accidental complexity. Please note that **I will not explain how to create simple UIs**. **Since front-end development is inherently complex, I’ll discuss complex topics to match that level.**

## Through Concrete Examples --- with-examples

All the techniques introduced here can be experienced directly on this site. Each section will explain where demos are available.

In addition, [all the code is publicly available on GitHub](https://github.com/naofumi/hotwire_anecdota). I recommend reading while referencing the repository or downloading it to try the examples locally.

## Technology Stack --- tech-stack

This site is primarily built with the following technologies:

* Ruby on Rails
* Hotwire
* SQLite3
* Tailwind CSS

## Local Installation --- local-installation

Please refer to the GitHub README. SQLite3 will be installed automatically, so the only dependency is Ruby. You’ll need to prepare an environment where Ruby runs on your own.
